Explanatory information about my homelab setup.

**********
This repo shows information about my homelab including devices I use, tools I use, how I use them, and the thought process behind decisions I have made.

A few things to note about this setup:
  - This comes from a mix of items I was able to collect over time.
  - I have extremely limited funds to spend, so many of these items are items I bought a long time ago, or I bought them somewhat recently but they were old and cheaper.
  - My knowledge in some areas is very strong, while I might be still learning in other areas, so some decisions may not make sense. I welcome feedback!
  - I try not to expose any information that could lead to me being doxxed or my devices/network being compromised, but just in case I have set this repo to private and only those with a link to see it can see it.
