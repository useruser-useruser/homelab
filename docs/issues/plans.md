# Plans

Here are the plans for the future (not in any kind of order):


## Purchases
- Purchase a dedicated device for OPNsense
- Purchase enough hard drives to create a proper RAID setup for data storage
- Purchase a managed switch (for learning purposes)

## Software
- Install Graylog on Debian server
- Install Headwind MDM on Debian server and smartphone
- Install ZenArmor on OPNsense

## Miscellaneous
- Find a use for this extremely outdated iPad Mini
- Find a use for some of my old smartphones if I can find a way to unlock them (some sort of low-power server)
- I started learning python in October 2025, so I am trying to continue with that so I can learn how to automate a lot of this
- I earned CompTIA Security+ and Linux+, next I want to get Network+
