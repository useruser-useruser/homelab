# Servers

I have three servers at the moment:
    - Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian 13 (Raspberry Pi OS)
    - VM running Debian 13
    - VM running Windows Server 2022

I haven't started using Windows Server; I only installed it.

The two servers run Debian 13 because every few months I like to tear everything down and set it back up, and most recently did this in early November 2025, soon after Raspberry Pi OS updated to Debian 13.
