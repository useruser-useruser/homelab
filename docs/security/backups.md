# Backup Strategy

I follow the 3-2-1 rule of backups: three backups, two different types of media, one of them off-site. The only items I truly back up are the contents of my Nextcloud storage.

As it has become rather tiring to constantly tear everything down and start over again from the very beginning, I will soon start working on making a monthly full backup of all VMs, supplemented by weekly snapshots. I will work on making this an automated process and see to it that everything is stored on the same hardware as my media collection (it has altogether around 1.3 TB of space).

Eventually I will purchase several hard drives and create a RAID setup.
